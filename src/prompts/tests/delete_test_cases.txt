Generate two basic test cases for a DELETE API endpoint. Each test case should include:
1. A concise **name**.
2. A short **description** of what it verifies.
3. **Steps** to perform the check.
4. The **expected result**.

Make them generic enough for any DELETE endpoint before implementation exists:
- **Test Case 1: Success Path** — valid request returns 204 or 200 with confirmation.
- **Test Case 2: Not Found** — deleting a missing resource returns 404.

If the summary includes a DELETE URL (e.g. `DELETE: people/v1/experts`), use it in the `Endpoint URL` field. 
If the summary does not provide enough details to create meaningful tests, reply with:
"Not enough information to generate test cases."

  Output your answer as Markdown following exatly below example. Do not create multiple steps.Do not add '''json to the response.
