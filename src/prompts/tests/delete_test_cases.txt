Generate three basic test cases for a DELETE API endpoint. Each test case should include:
1. A concise **name**.
2. A short **description** of what it verifies.
3. **Steps** to perform the check.
4. The **expected result**.

Make them generic enough for any DELETE endpoint before implementation exists:
- **Test Case 1: Success Path** — valid request returns 204 or 200 with confirmation.
- **Test Case 2: Not Found** — deleting a missing resource returns 404.
- **Test Case 3: Other Error** — server fault returns an appropriate error code (e.g. 500).

Output a JSON array of objects following this example:
```
[
  {
    "name": "Success - Delete Resource",
    "description": "Valid DELETE removes the resource.",
    "steps": ["DELETE /your/endpoint/1", "Check HTTP status"],
    "expected": {"status": 204, "body": null}
  }
]
```
