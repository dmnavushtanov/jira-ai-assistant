Generate two basic test cases for a POST API endpoint. Each test case should include:
1. A concise **name**.
2. A short **description** of what it verifies.
3. **Steps** to perform the check.
4. The **expected result**.

Make them generic enough for any POST endpoint before implementation exists:
- **Test Case 1: Success Path** — valid body returns 201 with created resource.
- **Test Case 2: Client Error** — missing or invalid fields returns 400 with an error message.

If the summary does not provide enough details to create meaningful tests, reply with:
"Not enough information to generate test cases."

Output a JSON array of objects following this example:
